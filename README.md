# Cub3D
A 42 project from the 3d circle of the Common Core.

It consists in developing a raycaster, using a minimal school-provided graphics library as a mere abstaction layer for the OS' display system.

The program parses a map and the necessary rendering parameters from a *.cub* file, displays an interactive first-person 3D view of the map and allows the player to move within its boundaries.
